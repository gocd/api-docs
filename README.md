### Configure and install middleman

```
$ bundle install --path .bundle --binstubs
```

### Run the API documentation locally on http://localhost:4567

```
$ bundle exec ./bin/middleman server
```

### Generating the static website

```
$ ./bin/rake build
```

### Publish the website to Github Pages

```
$ ./bin/rake publish
```

### Releasing a new version of the API

Assuming current stable is `16.3.0`, you are about to release `16.4.0` and the next version is going to be `16.5.0`, you would execute —

```bash
rake bump_version CURRENT_VERSION=16.3.0 VERSION_TO_RELEASE=16.4.0  NEXT_VERSION=16.5.0 REMOTE_NAME=upstream
```
