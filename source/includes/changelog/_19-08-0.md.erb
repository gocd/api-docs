## Changes in 19.8.0

### Added

- Introduced version 1 of [Mailserver Config API](#mailserver-config)
- It is now possible to omit the version number by specifying `Accept: application/vnd.go.cd+json`. This will render the latest version of the API endpoint being invoked.

### Removed

- The Pipeline Config API version 6 has been removed. [Version 8](#pipeline-config) of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
- The Config Repo API version 1 has been removed. [Version 2](#config-repo) of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
- Cookie/Session authentication should no longer be used for API authentication. Users should either use Basic Authentication or Token based authentication for any API requests going forward.
