# Notification Filters

The notification filters API allows the authenticated user to manage their notification filters.

> The API depends on the
[SMTP settings](https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/admin_mailhost_info.html) and without it, the API will fail with
following message.

```json
{
  "message": "SMTP settings are currently not configured. Ask your administrator to configure SMTP settings."
}
```
